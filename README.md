# PhonologyGYM: A Phonological Interpretability Benchmark

Phonotactically real, Minimal Pairs targeting phonologically contrastive datasets.

## Probing Emergent Phonology in Phoneme Language Models. 

- Real Pseudowords generated using Wuggy 
- **First-Order Violations:** Phonological Minimal Pairs â€“ Assimilation, Dissimilation based on P-BASE
- **Second-Order Violations:** Feeding, Bleeding and Counterbleeding

Evaluation using Relative normalised cross-entropy, normalised. Measure between real word and non-word  


## Preprocessing 

We use Wuggy pseudowords and systematise features from P-BASE, a phonological database from Jeff Mielke et al.
